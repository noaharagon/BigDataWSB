# Big Data Analytics: Group Project and Take Home Exercises

## Authors: Jonas Schmitten & Noah Angara

## Summary
* Repo for the course "Big Data Analytics", which consists of a group project and take home exercises
* Group Project: Sentiment analysis of WSB comments and backtesting an investment strategy based on sentiment/mentions using Amazon Web Services (EC2)
* Take Home Exercises: Analyze a large collection of FEC Data using big data strategies from class
* For security reasons, the code is not in a fully reproducible format (e.g. exclude Amazon access keys)

# Repository structure

## Code
All of the group project code is stored in the `SentimentAnalysisWSB.R` file. The code for the take home exercises is in `TakeHomeExercises.R`, while the final research report is in an RMarkdown format under `research_report.RMD`.

## Data
We use the WSB comments data set from kaggle under https://www.kaggle.com/mattpodolak/reddit-wallstreetbets-comments. To match posts to stock tickers we downloaded the csv from https://datahub.io/core/nyse-other-listings. The FEC data is under https://sunlightlabs.github.io/datacommons/bulk_data.html.

## Presentation Slides
Slides for the group project presentation are stored under Schmitten, Angara Big Data WSB Sentiment Analysis.pdf
